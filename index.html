                    <h3 class="heading">Why are we taking action</h3>
                    <p>We are horrified by what we are witnessing every day in Gaza and The West Bank, and appalled that only a tiny minority of governments are willing to act with genuine humanity. </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Like many people around the world, we realised that our only choice was to come together as a group, determined to help children who have had traumatic, life changing amputations.</p>

                <div class="row4">
                    <h3 class="heading">Why prosthetics?</h3>
                    <p>Because traumatic amputations are life changing injuries. Imagine the grief, pain and disability that thousands of children are suffering right now, many no longer with parents to care for them.</p>

                    <p>We come from different walks of life, different cultures, ethnicities and countries, but we see ourselves as citizens of the world. We recognise that this is the defining moment of our lives and that working together, in compassion, is the only way forward.

                    <h3 class="heading">Our journey so far</h3>
                    <p>We have discovered that there are millions of good people in the world. We are in conversations with many NGOs and have recently partnered with a surgeon who is travelling for the second time to Gaza, from Ireland, to operate. The charity LN4 Hands has generously given us 50 prosthetic hands to deliver to Gaza, and we are in constant contact with several doctors and health care workers within Gaza who are in desperate need of supplies which we are trying to obtain and deliver.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>We are determined to help Palestinians, now and on their long road to freedom, self-determination, and recovery.</p>
